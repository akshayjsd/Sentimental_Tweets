# Sentimental_Tweets
Takes an input search term and gives the term's impression on Twitter using sentiment analyisis.
Also creates a CSV file of test tweets.

It makes use of tweepy and textblob. A variation using Pattern from http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pattern has also been added.

tweepy is used to interact with the Twitter api while textblob helps separate the tweets into separate individual words and then using NLP and sentiment analysis an impression of the search term is provided.

Variation using Pattern was added which prevents the need for the Twitter authentication API.
